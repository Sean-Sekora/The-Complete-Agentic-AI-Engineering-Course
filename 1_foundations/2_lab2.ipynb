Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

       "\n",
       "**I. Core Components and Architecture:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Centralized Communication Hub:**  This is the heart of the tool.  It should aggregate all communication related to a specific custom order into a single thread, regardless of the communication channel (e.g., Etsy messages, direct email integration, potentially even SMS notifications).\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Design Review and Approval System:**  A dedicated space for design files (images, mockups, CAD drawings, etc.) to be uploaded, annotated, reviewed, and approved by both the seller and the buyer.  Version control is crucial.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Manufacturing Tracking Module:**  Allows the seller to update the order's progress through various stages (e.g., \"Design Approved,\" \"Materials Ordered,\" \"In Production,\" \"Packaging,\" \"Shipped\").  Customers get real-time visibility.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Etsy API Integration:**  The tool must connect to the Etsy API to automatically pull order details, customer information, and synchronize messages.  This is essential for automating many processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **User Management and Roles:**  Clear distinction between shop owner (seller) and customer roles.  Shop owners might have admin roles that allow them to manage other employees who help with order fulfillment.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Notification System:**  Email and/or in-app notifications to alert users of new messages, design updates, approval requests, and progress updates.\n",
       "\n",
       "**II. Key Features:**\n",
       "\n",
       "**A. Communication Enhancement:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Unified Inbox:**  All Etsy messages, emails, and potentially even SMS (optional) related to a specific order are grouped into one threaded conversation view.\n",
       "*   **Message Templates:**  Pre-written responses to common questions (e.g., \"Thank you for your order,\" \"Can you provide details about your custom request?\"). Customizable templates save time.\n",
       "*   **File Sharing Directly in Messages:** Seamlessly upload and share design files, photos, and other relevant documents directly within the communication thread.\n",
       "*   **Searchable History:**  Easily search through past conversations and order details.\n",
       "*   **Order Context in Messages:**  Automatically display key order information (order number, requested delivery date, design files) within the message view.\n",
       "*   **Multi-language Support:**  Important for international Etsy shops.\n",

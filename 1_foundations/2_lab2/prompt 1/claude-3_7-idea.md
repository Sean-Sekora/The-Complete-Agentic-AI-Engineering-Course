# Designing a Custom Order Management Tool for Etsy Sellers

To create an effective tool for Etsy custom orders, I recommend focusing on these key components:

## Core Features

1. **Streamlined Communication Hub**
   - Centralized messaging interface that organizes conversations by order
   - Template responses for common questions
   - Auto-translation for international customers
   - Voice-to-text for quick responses on mobile

2. **Design Collaboration Platform**
   - Interactive mockup sharing with annotation capabilities
   - Version control for design iterations
   - Split-screen comparison of design versions
   - AR visualization for applicable products (jewelry, home decor)

3. **Order Tracking Dashboard**
   - Production timeline with automated status updates
   - Progress visualization (design → approval → production → shipping)
   - Integration with Etsy's existing order management
   - Customizable production milestones

## Integration Approach

- **Etsy API Connection**: Seamless synchronization with shop inventory, pricing, and policies
- **Cloud-Based Storage**: Secure file sharing for designs and reference materials
- **Mobile-First Design**: Ensuring functionality across devices
- **Notification System**: Timely alerts for messages, approvals, and production updates

## User Experience Considerations

- Simple onboarding process with templates based on product category
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- Clear customer-facing experience that maintains the Etsy aesthetic
- Privacy controls for sensitive design information

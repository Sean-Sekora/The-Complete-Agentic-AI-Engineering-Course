Here's a comprehensive approach to building a custom order management tool for Etsy sellers:

## Core Communication Hub

- Template responses for common questions
- Real-time notifications across devices

**Smart Order Intake**
- Customizable order forms with conditional questions
- Visual requirement gathering (mood boards, reference images)
- Automatic price calculation based on specifications
- Integration with Etsy's custom order system

## Design Review Workflow

**Collaborative Design Space**
- Visual mockup sharing with annotation tools
- Version control for design iterations
- Side-by-side comparison views
- Mobile-friendly approval process for customers

**Approval Pipeline**
- Clear approval stages with customer sign-offs
- Automated reminders for pending approvals
- Change request tracking with cost implications
- Digital contracts and terms acceptance

## Manufacturing & Progress Tracking

**Production Dashboard**
- Kanban-style boards for order stages
- Time tracking for each production phase
- Photo documentation of work-in-progress
- Material and inventory management

**Customer-Facing Updates**
- Branded progress portal with real-time updates
- Photo galleries of work stages
- Shipping integration with tracking
- Delivery confirmation and feedback collection

## Technical Implementation

**Integration Layer**

- Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal) integration
- Cloud storage for design files and documentation

**User Experience Design**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Drag-and-drop file uploads

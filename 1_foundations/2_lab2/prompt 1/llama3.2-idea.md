2. Make sure the tool is accessible across various devices and browsers.
3. Use branding guidelines for social media sharing and promotion.

**Development Phases:**

1. Research and planning (2-4 weeks)
2. Design development (4-6 weeks)
3. Front-end and back-end development (12-16 weeks)
4. Testing, debugging, and QA (8-12 weeks)
5. Launch preparation and marketing materials creation (4-8 weeks)

**Tools and Resources:**

1. Development frameworks (e.g., React, Angular).
2. Integrated design tools (e.g., Sketch, Figma).
3. Database and storage solutions (e.g., MySQL, AWS S3).
4. Communication channel integrations (e.g., Mailgun, Twilio).

To create a seamless user experience, consider using modern best practices such as:

* Scalability and high-performance architecture.
